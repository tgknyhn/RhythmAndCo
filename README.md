<h1>Origin</h1>

I like playing guitar but sometimes I am having rough time learning tracks using tabletures. Tabs are quite helpful if you don't know musical note notation however it lacks some important information about a note such as how long you need to play it. <br>

Because of that, I decided developing Rhythm & Co. It is also my first graduation project at Gebze Technical University. I developed it using Swift and SwiftUI. <br>

<h1>Features</h1>

* Importing a MIDI file
* Selecting a track of imported song
* Start/Pause/Reset buttons
* Home button to select a new song or track
* Checking where to press on guitar to create current note sound using fretboard view.
* Checking how long a note need to be pressed using MIDI Sequencer
* Seeing musical note representation of your (guitar's) voice. 
* Real-time comparison between your voice and note needs to be played at that moment.
* Checking which notes you've played wrong at the end of the track.
* Checking how many correct and incorrect notes you've played in real-time.

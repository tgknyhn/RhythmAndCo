<h1>Origin</h1>

I like playing guitar but sometimes I am having rough time learning tracks using tabletures. Tabs are quite helpful if you don't know musical note notation however it lacks some important information about a note such as how long you need to play it. <br>

Because of that, I decided developing Rhythm & Co. It is also my first graduation project at Gebze Technical University. I developed it using Swift and SwiftUI. <br>

If you are interested with the details of the project, you may want to read my [graduation project report](https://github.com/tgknyhn/GTU/blob/main/Cse495/Graduation%20Project%20Report.pdf).

Also, I uploaded a Demo play to the Youtube. It is public and you can watch it from [here](https://youtu.be/t0z5uf2Mu-E). 

<h1>Features</h1>

* Import function (for MIDI files)
* Select track button (for the tracks inside a MIDI file)
* Start/Pause/Reset/Home buttons
* Fretboard view (to see where to press on guitar in order to play correct note)
* Note duration view (MIDI Sequencer)
* Musical note representation of microphone input.
* Real-time note comparison between the microphone input and the note needs to be played.
* Scrollable scroll view after finishing the song (to see correct and incorrect plays) -disabled during song-
* Real-time correct/incorrect count view.
